      # Learn about Delta Sharing
      Delta Sharing is the open protocol for sharing data from your Data Mesh!

      In this first challenge, you'll verify our environment to work with. Please wait while we
      boot a virtual machine for you.
  assignment: |
    Use this command to check all services are running smoothly:

    ```
    docker ps
    ```

    Did you also notice the tab called `Jupyter`. We will need them in the next challenges.

    We expect 5 docker containers to show here.
    In the next challenge we will investigate those further.

    To complete the
    challenge, press **Check**.

      In this second challenge, we'll explain our environment more in-depth.
  assignment: |
    Next to the terminal tab you might notice the tab called `Jupyter`. 
    We will use this a lot in the next challenges.

    Go to this `Jupyter` tab and fill in the requested token `datamesh`.
